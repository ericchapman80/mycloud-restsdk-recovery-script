# File Transfer Script Improvement & Optimization Tasks

## 1. Performance Review ‚úÖ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want a thorough review of the file transfer script to identify and address performance bottlenecks, especially around multi-threading and I/O, so that large transfers complete in a reasonable time.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Profile the script to identify slowest operations (disk, network, CPU, logging).
        - Benchmark current throughput for different thread counts.
        - Analyze the impact of file size and file count on performance.
        - Compare threading vs. multiprocessing approaches for I/O.
        - Produce a summary report of bottlenecks and potential improvements.

## 2. Pre-flight Configuration & Hardware Inspection ‚úÖ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want a pre-flight mode (CLI option) that inspects the hardware (CPU, RAM, disk speeds, network) and both source and destination disks, so that the script can recommend or auto-tune optimal settings (e.g., thread count, buffer sizes).
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Implement a cross-platform Python module to collect CPU, RAM, disk, and network information (using `psutil`, `platform`, etc.).
        - Benchmark disk read/write speeds and network throughput between source and destination.
        - Analyze file size distribution and count in the source directory.
        - Suggest or auto-tune optimal thread/process count and buffer sizes based on hardware and file characteristics.
        - Print a summary report and recommended settings before transfer starts.

## 3. Estimated Duration Calculation ‚úÖ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the pre-flight mode to estimate the total duration required for the transfer based on hardware/network benchmarks, so I can plan accordingly.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Use measured disk/network speeds and total data size to estimate transfer duration.
        - Account for file count and average size to estimate overhead from file operations.
        - Display estimated best-case and worst-case durations in the pre-flight report.

## 4. Accurate Progress Reporting üü° **In Progress**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the script to report percentage completion accurately, including accounting for files not found in the database and any other skipped or errored files.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Track all files (copied, skipped, missing, errored) in progress calculations.
        - Update the progress bar or percentage after every file operation.
        - Log and summarize skipped/missing/errored files in the final report.

## 5. Resumable/Checkpointed Transfers üü° **In Progress**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the script to be reliably re-runnable and able to resume from where it left off after interruptions (e.g., power loss), using a progress or checkpoint file.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Use an atomic, append-only log or checkpoint file for completed files.
        - On startup, scan the checkpoint file and skip already-copied files.
        - Optionally, checkpoint progress periodically (not just on successful copy).
        - Ensure log file is written atomically (e.g., write to temp then rename).

## 6. Regenerate Progress File ‚è≥ **To Do**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want a CLI option to regenerate the progress/input file, so I can resume transfers efficiently after interruptions or changes.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Add a command-line option to scan the source directory and regenerate the progress file.
        - Ensure the regenerated file matches the current state of source/destination.
        - Validate and handle edge cases (e.g., missing or moved files).

## 7. Review Performance PR ‚è≥ **To Do**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and incorporate suggestions from the open PR regarding performance improvements, ensuring best practices and code quality.  The requested changes are on this branch: https://github.com/ericchapman80/mycloud-restsdk-recovery-script/tree/devin/1747514727-optimize-file-copy
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Review changes in the PR for performance, correctness, and maintainability.
        - Compare PR branch performance to the current main branch.
        - Integrate the best changes, refactor as needed, and update documentation.

## 8. Task List Maintenance üîÑ **Ongoing**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want this list of improvement and optimization tasks to be tracked in the repo, so that progress can be monitored and tasks can be assigned or prioritized.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Keep the improvement task list up to date as work progresses.
        - Add new user stories or implementation notes as new issues are discovered.
        - Use the task list for prioritization and progress tracking.

## 9. Automated Testing and Test Harness ‚è≥ **To Do**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust, easy-to-use automated test harness (using pytest and/or unittest) to protect against functional drift and regressions as the codebase evolves.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        1. Switch to pytest for simplicity and modern Python testing features.
        2. Add/expand tests for all utility and helper functions, including new modules (e.g., preflight), file/log/progress logic, and error handling.
        3. Refactor functions to accept injected dependencies (e.g., dictionaries, paths) for easier and more isolated unit testing.
        4. Add CLI and output tests using pytest's capsys/capfd for terminal output (especially for pre-flight summary and recommendations).
        5. Set up a test runner script and/or GitHub Actions CI workflow for continuous automated testing and protection against regressions.
