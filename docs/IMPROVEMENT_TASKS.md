# File Transfer Script Improvement & Optimization Tasks

## 1. Performance Review ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want a thorough review of the file transfer script to identify and address performance bottlenecks, especially around multi-threading and I/O, so that large transfers complete in a reasonable time.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Profile the script to identify slowest operations (disk, network, CPU, logging).
        - Benchmark current throughput for different thread counts.
        - Analyze the impact of file size and file count on performance.
        - Compare threading vs. multiprocessing approaches for I/O.
        - Produce a summary report of bottlenecks and potential improvements.

## 2. Pre-flight Configuration & Hardware Inspection ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want a pre-flight mode (CLI option) that inspects the hardware (CPU, RAM, disk speeds, network) and both source and destination disks, so that the script can recommend or auto-tune optimal settings (e.g., thread count, buffer sizes).
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Implement a cross-platform Python module to collect CPU, RAM, disk, and network information (using `psutil`, `platform`, etc.).
        - Benchmark disk read/write speeds and network throughput between source and destination.
        - Analyze file size distribution and count in the source directory.
        - Suggest or auto-tune optimal thread/process count and buffer sizes based on hardware and file characteristics.
        - Print a summary report and recommended settings before transfer starts.

## 3. Estimated Duration Calculation ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the pre-flight mode to estimate the total duration required for the transfer based on hardware/network benchmarks, so I can plan accordingly.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Use measured disk/network speeds and total data size to estimate transfer duration.
        - Account for file count and average size to estimate overhead from file operations.
        - Display estimated best-case and worst-case durations in the pre-flight report.

## 4. Accurate Progress Reporting ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the script to report percentage completion accurately, including accounting for files not found in the database and any other skipped or errored files.
    - **Implementation Approach (Final):**
        - All files (copied, skipped, errored) are tracked and reported in both log and console output.
        - Progress and summary reporting includes counts for all categories, with robust end-of-run reconciliation (source, destination, copied, skipped, errored, processed).
        - Skipped/problem files are logged and stored in the `skipped_files` table; already copied files are tracked in `copied_files`.
        - The user receives periodic feedback during long operations (e.g., log regeneration), and the README contains detailed FAQ/database safety instructions.

## 5. Resumable/Checkpointed Transfers ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the script to be reliably re-runnable and able to resume from where it left off after interruptions (e.g., power loss), using a progress or checkpoint file.
    - **Implementation Approach (Hybrid Log + Database):**
        - **Hybrid Tracking:** The script maintains both a human-readable log file (e.g., `copied_file.log`) and a dedicated `copied_files` table in the database to track which files have been copied. This ensures redundancy, speed, and auditability.
        - **Log/DB Sync:** On every `--resume` or `--create-log`, the script scans the destination directory and updates both the log file and the `copied_files` table to reflect all files currently present at the destination.
        - **Copy Logic:** After each successful copy, the file is appended to the log and inserted into the `copied_files` table.
        - **Filtering:** When determining which files to process, the script uses a SQL join to exclude any files already present in the `copied_files` table (and optionally in a `skipped_files` table for permanently skipped/problem files). This avoids loading millions of file paths into memory and leverages database indexing for speed.
        - **CLI options:** `--resume`, `--regen-log`, `--no-regen-log` control resumability and log/DB sync behavior.
        - **Rationale:**
            - **Safety:** The main `FILES` table is never altered, preserving the original metadata and reducing risk of corruption.
            - **Redundancy:** If either the log or the database state is lost/corrupted, the other can be used to recover.
            - **Auditability:** The log file provides a human-readable backup and audit trail.
            - **Performance:** SQL filtering and indexing make this approach scalable to millions of files without excessive memory use.
        - **See the README for usage details and examples.**

## 6. Regenerate Progress File ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a user, I want a CLI option to regenerate the progress/input file, so I can resume transfers efficiently after interruptions or changes.
    - **Implementation Approach (Final):**
        - The script provides `--regen-log` and `--create-log` CLI options to scan the destination directory and regenerate both the log file and the copied_files table.
        - The regenerated file and database state always match the current state of the destination, ensuring robust resumability.
        - Edge cases (missing/moved files) are handled by direct scanning and reconciliation.

## 7. Review Performance PR ⏳ **To Do**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and incorporate suggestions from the open PR regarding performance improvements, ensuring best practices and code quality.  The requested changes are on this branch: https://github.com/ericchapman80/mycloud-restsdk-recovery-script/tree/devin/1747514727-optimize-file-copy
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        - Review changes in the PR for performance, correctness, and maintainability.
        - Compare PR branch performance to the current main branch.
        - Integrate the best changes, refactor as needed, and update documentation.

## 8. Task List Maintenance ✅ **Complete**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want this list of improvement and optimization tasks to be tracked in the repo, so that progress can be monitored and tasks can be assigned or prioritized.
    - **Implementation Approach (Final):**
        - The improvement task list has been kept up to date throughout development, with new user stories and implementation notes added as issues were discovered and addressed.
        - The list has been used for prioritization, progress tracking, and documentation of completed work.

## 9. Automated Testing and Test Harness ⏳ **To Do**
- **User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust, easy-to-use automated test harness (using pytest and/or unittest) to protect against functional drift and regressions as the codebase evolves.
    - **Implementation Approach:**
        1. Switch to pytest for simplicity and modern Python testing features.
        2. Add/expand tests for all utility and helper functions, including new modules (e.g., preflight), file/log/progress logic, and error handling.
        3. Refactor functions to accept injected dependencies (e.g., dictionaries, paths) for easier and more isolated unit testing.
        4. Add CLI and output tests using pytest's capsys/capfd for terminal output (especially for pre-flight summary and recommendations).
        5. Set up a test runner script and/or GitHub Actions CI workflow for continuous automated testing and protection against regressions.
