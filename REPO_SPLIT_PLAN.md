# Repository Split Plan

> **✅ COMPLETE:** This plan has been executed. The repository has been split into:
> - [wd-mycloud-rsync-recovery](https://github.com/ericchapman80/wd-mycloud-rsync-recovery) (recommended)
> - [wd-mycloud-python-recovery](https://github.com/ericchapman80/wd-mycloud-python-recovery) (legacy)

## Executive Summary

Split the current monorepo into two focused repositories to improve maintainability, clarity, and user experience.

## Current State (Monorepo)

**Repository:** `mycloud-restsdk-recovery-script`
- Mixed legacy (restsdk_public.py) and modern (rsync_restore.py) approaches
- Confusing for new users which tool to use
- Different dependencies and use cases
- Maintenance burden tracking both codebases

## Proposed State (Two Repos)

### Repo 1: wd-mycloud-python-recovery (Legacy)
**Purpose:** Archived/maintenance-only Python-based recovery tool

**What stays:**
- `restsdk_public.py` - Core legacy script
- `sync_mtime.py` - Post-recovery mtime sync for --low-memory runs
- `preflight.py` - System analysis & thread recommendations (shared with modern)
- `create_symlink_farm.py` - Symlink-based deduplication
- `mtime_check.py` - Metadata utilities
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script (shared with modern)
- `run_tests.sh` - Test runner (adapted for legacy tests)
- `tests/test_restsdk_public.py` - Python tool tests
- `tests/test_restsdk_high_value.py` - High-value function tests
- `tests/test_db_flows.py` - Database workflow tests
- `tests/test_symlink_farm.py` - Symlink tests
- Legacy documentation sections from README.md

**README focus:**
- "⚠️ This tool is in maintenance mode - use wd-mycloud-rsync-recovery for new projects"
- Python-based approach documentation
- Troubleshooting for existing users
- Migration guide to rsync tool

**Branch strategy:**
- `main` - frozen at last stable release
- `maintenance` - critical bug fixes only

---

### Repo 2: wd-mycloud-rsync-recovery (Modern - Recommended)
**Purpose:** Active development, rsync-based recovery with cleanup features

**What moves here:**
- `rsync_restore.py` - Core rsync wrapper
- `preflight.py` - System analysis & thread recommendations (shared with legacy)
- `monitor.sh` - Progress monitoring for rsync operations
- `setup.sh` - Environment setup script (shared with legacy)
- `run_tests.sh` - Test runner (adapted for modern tests)
- `tests/test_perf_regen_log.py` - Performance tests
- `README-SYMLINK-FARM.md` → becomes main README.md
- New cleanup feature and config

**README focus:**
- Recommended approach for all users
- Wizard mode walkthrough
- Cleanup feature documentation
- Performance comparison vs Python tool
- Advanced rsync options

**Branch strategy:**
- `main` - stable releases
- `develop` - active development
- Feature branches for new capabilities

---

## Shared Components

### What goes in BOTH repos:
- `preflight.py` - System analysis tool (useful for both recovery approaches)
- `setup.sh` - Python venv setup (both repos need Python environment)
- `run_tests.sh` - Test runner (adapted for each repo's test suite)
- Database schema documentation (`sql-data.info`)
- Link to sister repo in README

### Duplication strategy:
- **Option B:** Duplicate and let them diverge (simpler, more maintainable)
- **Recommendation:** Option B - repos serve different audiences and shared files will evolve independently

### File Placement Rationale:

| File | Legacy Repo | Modern Repo | Reasoning |
|------|:-----------:|:-----------:|-----------|
| `sync_mtime.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Fixes `--low-memory` limitation in restsdk_public.py; rsync preserves timestamps automatically |
| `preflight.py` | ✅ | ✅ | Universal system analysis—provides thread recommendations for both approaches |
| `setup.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | Both repos need Python virtual environment setup |
| `run_tests.sh` | ✅ | ✅ | Both repos have test suites; script will be adapted for each |
| `create_symlink_farm.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Legacy Python deduplication strategy |
| `mtime_check.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Validation utility specific to Python recovery workflow |
| `monitor.sh` | ❌ | ✅ | Rsync-specific progress monitoring |
| `tests/test_db_flows.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Database tests for Python workflow |
| `tests/test_symlink_farm.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Tests legacy deduplication |
| `tests/test_perf_regen_log.py` | ❌ | ✅ | Performance tests for rsync approach |
- **Option A:** Git submodule for shared code
- **Option B:** Duplicate and let them diverge (simpler, more maintainable)
- **Recommendation:** Option B - repos serve different audiences and `preflight.py` may diverge over time to add tool-specific checks

### File Placement Rationale:

| File | Legacy Repo | Modern Repo | Reasoning |
|------|:-----------:|:-----------:|-----------|
| `sync_mtime.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Fixes `--low-memory` limitation in restsdk_public.py; rsync preserves timestamps automatically |
| `preflight.py` | ✅ | ✅ | Universal system analysis—provides thread recommendations for both approaches |
| `create_symlink_farm.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Legacy Python deduplication strategy |
| `mtime_check.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Validation utility specific to Python recovery workflow |
| `monitor.sh` | ❌ | ✅ | Rsync-specific progress monitoring |
| `tests/test_db_flows.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Database tests for Python workflow |
| `tests/test_symlink_farm.py` | ✅ | ❌ | Tests legacy deduplication |
| `tests/test_perf_regen_log.py` | ❌ | ✅ | Performance tests for rsync approach |

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Split

**Python Recovery (Legacy):**
- Python 3.9+
- SQLite3
- Minimal dependencies (maintenance)

**Rsync Restore (Modern):**
- Python 3.9+
- rsync 3.0+
- PyYAML (optional for cleanup config)
- Active dependency updates

### Testing Strategy

**Phase 0 Testing (Pre-Split Validation):**

**Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Test legacy subdirectory
cd legacy
./setup.sh
./run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh html

# Test modern subdirectory
cd ../modern
./setup.sh
./run_tests.sh

# Verify all tests pass in both subdirectories
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

*Legacy Subdirectory (`legacy/`):*
- [ ] Run preflight analysis: `python preflight.py <source> <dest>`
- [ ] Test restsdk_public.py basic recovery (small test dataset):
  ```bash
  python restsdk_public.py --db test.db --filedir /test/source --dumpdir /test/dest
  ```
- [ ] Test --low-memory mode
- [ ] Run sync_mtime.py on test recovery (verify timestamps sync)
- [ ] Test create_symlink_farm.py deduplication
- [ ] Run mtime_check.py validation
- [ ] Verify all imports resolve correctly from subdirectory
- [ ] Check that tests discover and run properly

*Modern Subdirectory (`modern/`):*
- [ ] Run preflight analysis: `python preflight.py <source> <dest>`
- [ ] Test rsync_restore.py basic recovery (small test dataset)
- [ ] Test monitor.sh progress tracking
- [ ] Verify rsync preserves timestamps (no sync_mtime.py needed)
- [ ] Verify all imports resolve correctly from subdirectory
- [ ] Check that tests discover and run properly

*Cross-Validation:*
- [ ] Recover same test dataset with both approaches
- [ ] Compare file counts, sizes, timestamps
- [ ] Verify modern approach doesn't need sync_mtime.py
- [ ] Confirm preflight.py works identically in both subdirectories

**Post-Split Testing:**

**Legacy Repo:**
- Existing test suite maintained
- Run on critical paths only
- No new test development
- CI runs on: Pull requests to `maintenance` branch

**Modern Repo:**
- Expand test coverage
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests with cleanup
- CI runs on: All PRs, nightly performance tests

## Rollback Plan

If split causes issues:
1. Keep monorepo as `v2.0.0-unified` tag
2. Redirect users back temporarily
3. Merge improvements back to monorepo
4. Re-evaluate split approach

**Risk Assessment:** LOW
- Both tools already function independently
- No shared runtime dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Get feedback/approval
2. **Run split simulation** - Test locally first
3. **Execute Phase 1** - Tag and prepare
4. **Communicate** - Announce to users/watchers
5. **Execute split** - Create new repos
6. **Monitor** - Track issues and smooth transition
